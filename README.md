Clear screen like Unix in Windows Command prompt.<br>
🖥️ [Command prompt](https://www.npmjs.com/package/clear.cmd),
📜 [Files](https://unpkg.com/clear.cmd/),

[clear] (similar to `cls` in Windows [Command prompt]) is a [builtin shell command]
in various Unix shells (such as [bash]), which **clears the terminal** by
*scrolling down* (until old output is not visible) and *resetting the cursor* to the
top-left corner of the screen. This package provides the same behaviour as Unix
`clear` (as mentioned above) on the *Windows Command prompt*. [Source code] for the
executable is written in `C#`.
